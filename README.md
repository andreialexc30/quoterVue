<h1>About the project</h1>
Web based quote generator that is easy to use. Remade from vanilla with VueJS.
<h2>Description</h2>
This random quote generator fetches a random quote alongside it's author (if available) from an quotes API, and displays it for the user to see. The new ramade quoter has been created with the VueJS framework. At the moment I am experimenting with JavaScript frameworks and will try to remake different vanilla projects into framework projects. VueJS seems to have an easier learning curve as I managed to grasp it pretty easily, even if my randomQuoter project isn't very in depth and I just scratched the surface.
